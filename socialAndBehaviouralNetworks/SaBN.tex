\section{First-Edge algorithm}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be an undirected graph. We want to infer the structure of $G$ by looking at how information spreads through it.\\We consider information flow to follow a push-pull model. In this model information randomly appears at a source node $s$, at each round the nodes that have the information push it to an uninformed neighbouring node, chosen \textbf{U}niformly \textbf{A}t \textbf{R}andom, the nodes that do not have the information try to pull it from a neighbouring node, chosen UAR.\\If we can track when information appears at each node we can build a trace, that is, an ordered list of pairs $p_i = (v_i, T_i)$ where $T_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is the time at which the information first appeared at node $v_i \in V$ and $\forall i,j \, |\, i\neq j  \quad p_i \geq p_j \implies T_i \geq T_j$.
